### Structured community KI (AoK) data analysis tool

Created by: Global Emergencies Unit (Alvaro Gerns), Impact Initiatives, 2025.

The app link: <https://impact-initiatives.shinyapps.io/ki_analysis_app/>

#### Purpose:

The app provides a simple and standard tool to analyze structured community KI data (aka Area of Knowledge or AoK data). It can be used by anyone autonomously, even without specialised data analysis or coding skills. The app allows to do a plethora of steps:

1.  Aggregating KI-level data to higher administrative levels.
2.  Transform structured community KI data into desired analysis outputs that can be used as a basis for information products
3.  Explore the analyzed data through visualizations that can be downloaded.
4.  Create a Severity Index based on the UNDAC or AoK Indicator Bank and Acute Needs in Emergencies Framework.

It can be used as the analysis tool for any research cycle based on structured community KI (AoK) data, such as sudden onset assessments (e.g. conducted by UNDAC), Humanitarian Situation Monitoring (HSM), Multi-Sectoral Needs Assessments (MSNAs) in hard-to-reach areas, etc.

For guidance on structured community KI surveys, refer to the AoK Guidance Note or contact IMPACT HQ.
